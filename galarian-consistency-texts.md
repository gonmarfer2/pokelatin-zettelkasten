# Galarian Consistency within Texts

There are many instances within the texts found in Galar where words don't seem to share the same cipher. This is the case of:

- <thraex><red>GAFA</red>Z <red>B</red>E<red>CW</red>VE</thraex>: GALAR LEAGUE
- <thraex><red>X</red>V<red>C</red>YQ <red>W</red>QE<red>H</red>QE</thraex>: MACRO COSMOS
- <thraex>Abt<red>e</red>j Atpwhar<red>e</red>j</thraex>: Daily Discovery
- <thraex><red>I</red>rwtgepj <red>D</red>VZ</thraex>: Champion CUP
- <thraex>BQEFT<red>O</red> <red>K</red>LL</thraex>: SUBOMI INN (Budew's Inn)

This does not seem a simple contradiction, as it happens with [inconsistencies within words](./galarian-consistency-words.md); ciphers within words are consistent. If it were a Vinegere cipher, it's unlikely that both A's, E's, S's, and O's from the words remained the same.

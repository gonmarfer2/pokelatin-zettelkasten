# Kalosian Diacritics

It is known that the Kalosian version of PokéLatin introduces two new diacritics to the mix. These accent marks are paired only with a select number of characters:

|Accent mark|Uses|
|---|---|
|<thraex>~</thraex>|<thraex>~B</thraex>&emsp;<thraex>~S</thraex>&emsp;<thraex>~w</thraex>|
|<thraex>\`</thraex>|<thraex>\`R</thraex>&emsp;<thraex>\`D</thraex>&emsp;<thraex>\`P</thraex>&emsp;<thraex>\`q</thraex>&emsp;<thraex>\`e</thraex>|

Given that Kalos is a fictional region based on real-life France, it is possible that the designers at Game Freak added these diacritics as a gesture towards their alphabet, which is notorious by their many accent marks:

- Grave accent (`)
- Accute accent (´)
- Circumflex accent (^)
- Diaeresis (¨)
- Cedilla (ç)

It is not far-fetched, then, to relate the French diacritics to those used in Kalosian. The question lies on which ones match. The boundaries are the vowels (*a*,*e*,*i*,*o*,*u*) and *c* (only for cedilla).

> Study if the accented characters can be deciphered as a vowel or a C.

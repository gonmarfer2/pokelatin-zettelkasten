# Cases of inconsistency where there should not be any

There are some words found in Pok√©Latin games where the meaning is clear enough, but the cipher does not make sense, that is, it's inconsistent. Some of these words are listed below.

- *NORMAL*-<thraex>MJYMVL</thraex>: in this case, both *N* and *M* are ciphered as <thraex>M</thraex>, which does not really make sense. The text is found on the Normal type banner in Scarlet/Violet, and on the Normal type uniform in Sword/Shield; the amount of characters fit, and the rest of the ciphers don't contradict each other.
- *KAKUTO* - <thraex>LESBFQ</thraex> (SwSh) / <thraex>RLESBFQ</thraex> (SV): The Fighting type has a similar case, with the added problem of the <thraex>R</thraex> in SV.

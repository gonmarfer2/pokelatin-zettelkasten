# Words that changed in Paldean

Some Pokémon types have suffered a respelling in Paldea (SV) from their Galarian form (SwSh). Specifically, the following types have been affected:

|English|Galarian|Paldean|
|---|---|---|
|Dark|<thraex>ZIS</thraex>|<thraex>ZIE</thraex>|
|Poison|<thraex>ZHOV</thraex>|<thraex>ZhOV</thraex>|
|Steel|<thraex>WKDKJO</thraex>|<thraex>QKDKJE</thraex>|
|Fighting|<thraex>LESBFQ</thraex>|<thraex>RLESBFQ</thraex>|

From the previous words, these changes can be extracted:

- <thraex>S</thraex> → <thraex>E</thraex>
- <thraex>H</thraex> → <thraex>h</thraex>
- <thraex>W</thraex> → <thraex>Q</thraex>
- <thraex>O</thraex> → <thraex>E</thraex>

Here, we find a contradiction. Both <thraex>S</thraex> and <thraex>O</thraex> are turned to <thraex>E</thraex>. However, in the dark type, <thraex>E</thraex> supposedly replaces **U** (from Japanese AKU), while in the steel type, that same character supposedly replaces **E** (from Japanese HAGANE). Therefore, the main conclusion is that these words did not change to make them consistent with one cipher, but for other motives.

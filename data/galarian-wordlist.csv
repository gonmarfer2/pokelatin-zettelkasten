Sorta. They all seem to share the same number of characters between the Galarian name and their Katakana names… but they don’t seem to match. On the other hand, maybe they’re anagrams? Like, one Galarian character = one Katakana syllable, but somewhere in the name, perhaps S = ン, or 3 = ー. The second word of each entry, however, is garbage text and has no value.",SwSh,2025-05-18

It’s worth noting that W9SK ends with the same two characters as the word for “Ice” (BDSK). Is there a word in Japanese that means something like “Knocked out!” or “(you) lost!” that ends with “-ri”?",SwSh,2025-05-18

JEMXL is “Electric”, seen in the “Electric-type” uniform. Meanwhile, BC3S is “Water”, also seen on the “Water-type” uniform. So clearly those words were an intentional decision. Also, D+OX ZU24+O VV^63 in the presentation is also seen on a tshirt you can buy at the Boutique (see “Words on Clothes” above). I wonder if it’s something that Rose closes with all the time and is put on a tshirt as a symbol of hope (or sarcasm)?",SwSh,2025-05-18
